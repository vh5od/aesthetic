> Build agents that investigate first, focus on the main contradiction, validate in practice, and keep pushing until the work is actually done.

`qiushi-skill` is a collection of reusable methodology skills, commands, and session-start hooks. It turns a set of problem-solving methods into installable assets for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, and other prompt-driven hosts.

## Why This Exists

Many agents can generate text, but they still fail at disciplined work:

- they answer before collecting facts
- they scatter effort across too many tasks
- they stop at the first blocker
- they skip verification and call that "done"

`qiushi-skill` is meant to correct that with one core principle and nine concrete methods:

- `seeking truth from facts` as the governing principle
- contradiction analysis
- practice -> cognition -> practice iteration
- investigation first
- mass line feedback synthesis
- criticism and self-criticism
- protracted strategy
- concentrate forces
- spark a prairie fire
- overall planning

## Install

### Preferred: `npx qiushi-skill`

```bash
npx qiushi-skill
```

Non-interactive examples:

```bash
npx qiushi-skill install --target claude-code --scope user
npx qiushi-skill install --target claude-code,cursor --scope project
npx qiushi-skill install --target codex,opencode,openclaw,hermes,nanobot --scope user
npx qiushi-skill install --target all --scope user
npx qiushi-skill validate
npx qiushi-skill uninstall --target claude-code --scope user
```

The CLI is zero-dependency and does four things:

- installs standard plugin bundles for Claude Code and Cursor
- copies skills/commands into the directories scanned by Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, and nanobot
- writes `.qiushi-skill-install.json` manifests so uninstall only removes CLI-managed files
- validates the current checkout or published bundle with one Node-based code path
- keeps `install`, `validate`, and `uninstall` under one stable entrypoint

### Claude Code Official Marketplace

This repository now ships `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, so Claude Code can discover it directly from GitHub:

```text
/plugin marketplace add HughYau/qiushi-skill
/plugin install qiushi-skill@qiushi-skill
```

### Source Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HughYau/qiushi-skill
cd qiushi-skill
claude --plugin-dir .
```

### Platform Notes

- Claude Code: use the GitHub marketplace flow above, or `npx qiushi-skill install --target claude-code`.
- Cursor: use `npx qiushi-skill install --target cursor`, or copy the bundle to your configured plugins directory.
- Codex: use `npx qiushi-skill install --target codex`, or see [`.codex/INSTALL.md`](.codex/INSTALL.md).
- OpenCode: use `npx qiushi-skill install --target opencode`, or see [`.opencode/INSTALL.md`](.opencode/INSTALL.md).
- OpenClaw: use `npx qiushi-skill install --target openclaw`, or see [`.openclaw/INSTALL.md`](.openclaw/INSTALL.md).
- Hermes Agent: use `npx qiushi-skill install --target hermes`, or see [`.hermes/INSTALL.md`](.hermes/INSTALL.md).
- nanobot: use `npx qiushi-skill install --target nanobot`, or see [`.nanobot/INSTALL.md`](.nanobot/INSTALL.md).

## Validate

Preferred:

```bash
npx qiushi-skill validate
```

If you are working from a source checkout, legacy fallback scripts are also available:

```bash
bash tests/validate.sh
# or on Windows
powershell -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests/validate.ps1
```

Validation checks:

- JSON validity, including `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- version consistency between `package.json` and marketplace metadata
- presence of CLI files, hooks, commands, packaged platform guides, and the isolated marketplace bundle
- frontmatter completeness for skills, commands, and agents
- local Markdown link integrity

## How to Use It

The session-start entry skill is `skills/arming-thought/SKILL.md`. Its job is intentionally narrow:

1. enforce `seeking truth from facts`
2. choose downstream skills only when they clearly help
3. avoid loading every method by default

Manual command entrypoints live in `commands/*.md` for hosts that support Markdown slash commands.

## Platforms

- Claude Code: official marketplace + automatic SessionStart injection + commands
- Cursor: bundle metadata + commands + standard CLI install path
- OpenClaw: can map Claude/Cursor/Codex bundles into native OpenClaw plugins
- Hermes Agent: native `skills` directory and CLI/toolset workflow
- Codex: document-based setup
- OpenCode: document-based setup
- Generic hosts: reuse `skills/` and `commands/`
